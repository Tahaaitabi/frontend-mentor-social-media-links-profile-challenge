This one was pretty straight forward challenge. I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to get the layout I needed. 

The only bit I found tricky was the image but after a few YT tutorials I managed to get the desired effect. 

I worked off the JPEG image that was provided with this challenge and used rem units. 

It won't be 100% accurate but I will be happy with a 70% match on this one. 

Thank you Frontend Mentor for this challenge it was fun to make. 

If you have any advice on how I could have done this challenge more efficeintly, which I'm sure that there is a better way, feel free to comment or send me a message. 

Thank you!
